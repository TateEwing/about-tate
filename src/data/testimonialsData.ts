Tate ramped quickly to the product and led the revamp of the Validator feature which contributes ~$4M annually to DocuSignâ€™s revenue. He is fast to highlight any blockers and good at coordinating across other tech teams to unblock releases. He also thought through corner cases to ensure great customer experience. Highly recommend him for software development roles."

      relation: "Worked together at Docusign",
      recommendation: "I have worked closely with Tate Ewing for about 2.5 years. Tate joined as a junior developer and quickly build up his domain knowledge in our product - Validator for Life Sciences - and started delivering on it. System was complicated, with multiple dependencies in different stacks. It was obvious Tate had the tenacity to take complicated tasks and break them apart and get them done. [...] Tate has a great work ethic and he has always been a pleasure to work with. I would gladly recommend him to any employer looking for talented young engineers that would deliver strong results on any technical project."
